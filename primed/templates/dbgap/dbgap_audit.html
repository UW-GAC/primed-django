<h2>Audit results</h2>

<div class="my-3 p-3 bg-light border rounded shadow-sm">
  <p>
    For each dbGaP workspace and application in the app, the audit checks that access is correct.
    To have access to a workspace, the group associated with the dbGaP application must be a member of the authorization domain of that workspace. It does not check that the workspace is shared with the group.
  </p>
  <p>The audit result categories are explained below.
    <ul>

      <li><b>Verified</b> includes the following:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>No DAR is associated with this workspace and the group does not have access.</li>
          <li>There is a DAR associated with this workspace, but it is not approved, and the group does nto have access.</li>
          <li>There is an approved DAR associated with this workspace and the group has access.</li>
