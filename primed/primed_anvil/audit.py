    This class is intended to be subclassed in order to store all results for a PRIMED audit.
    Subclasses should implement the _run_audit class method to perform the audit. To run the
    audit itself, one can use the run_audit method, which calls the _run_audit method in
    addition to performs completion checks. Typically, _run_audit should loop over a set of
    instances or checks, and store the results in the `verified`, `needs_action`, and `errors`
    attributes.

    Attributes:
        verified: A list of PRIMEDAuditResult subclasses instances that have been verified.
        needs_action: A list of PRIMEDAuditResult subclasses instances that some sort of need action.
        errors: A list of PRIMEDAuditResult subclasses instances where an error has been detected.
        completed: A boolean indicator of whether the audit has been run.
