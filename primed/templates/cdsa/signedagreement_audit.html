<h1>Signed Agreement audit</h1>

<h2>Audit results</h2>

    For each dbGaP workspace in the app, the audit checks that access for this application is correct.
    To have access to a workspace, the group associated with the dbGaP application must be a member of the authorization domain of that workspace. It does not check that the workspace is shared with the group.
