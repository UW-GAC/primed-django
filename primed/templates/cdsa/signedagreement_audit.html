<h1>Signed Agreement audit</h1>

<h2>Audit results</h2>

<div class="my-3 p-3 bg-light border rounded shadow-sm">
  <p>
    For each Signed Agreement in the app, the audit checks that access is correct.
    To have access to CDSA workspaces, the group associated with the Signed Agreement must be a member of the PRIMED CDSA group. The audit does not check that the workspace is shared with the group.
  </p>
  <p>The audit result categories are explained below.
